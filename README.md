# Ignis-s-New-Recipe
My second project ever. Inspired by the video game Final Fantasy 15. Ignis, a cook in the video game, never had a restaurant but this is what it would be if he did. The "home" tab greets you with a single featured item that can be "switched" between a total of three items to be viewed. The "menu" tab contains many food items inside a container that is supposed to mimic a restaurant menu. The "contact" tab contains a form for comments. These same tabs are also present in the "mobile view", just with a compressed user friendly design.
