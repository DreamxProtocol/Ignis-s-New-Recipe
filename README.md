## What
  Ignis's New Recipe is a fictional restaurant website for the owner, Ignis. The purpose of this site is to inform customers of the food choices that the restaurant offers and to let them know that feedback is welcomed. 

## Why
  This project was inteded to focus more on the *CSS* side of web development. The goal was to experiment with the different possibilities of design and media queries.
  
## How
  The languages used to make this website were *HTML*, *CSS*, and *JavaScript*. The JavaScript used here triggered element manipulation in regard to a type of CSS animation/transition. All images used were edited using GIMP and Inkscape.
  
## Page Description
  - Desktop View
    
    When in the "Home" tab, the restaurants catchphrase is displayed towards the right just under the nav bar. Under the catchphrase is an image of a food item coming soon to the menu. There are clickable "dots" underneath the images to reveal additional "coming soon" items. In the "Menu" tab, a "Menu" button opens up the menu by changing the "transform" of some of the elements to reveal the menu food items. Four items(images) are grouped to one of four categories, displaying the name of the item and its price underneath the item. In the "Contact Us" tab, a form to the right of the screen is allowed to be filled out with a comment (*this is just a plain HTML form and not an actual feature*).
    
  - Mobile View
  
    *Note: "mobile" view is only accesible when in the "inspector"*
   
    When in the mobile view, something that is not available to the desktop view is a greeting from the restaurant owner Ignis. The nav bar is not displayed across the top of the screen but instead is inside a hamburger nav. The "Home" and "Contact Us" tabs are similar to the desktop view's version of the site. When in the "Menu" tab, the categories are mobile friendly and some of the details are hidden compared to the desktop view and only appear when the item is clicked on. The "Menu" button does not work here and the menu items are already visible.
